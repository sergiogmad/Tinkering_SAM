# tinkering-sam

In this notebook, I combine Meta's segmentation model called SAM (Segment Anything Model)

with a pretrained image classification model from the Timm library to create a simple Gradio

app. This app categorizes the objects found in an input image according to the ImageNet dataset,

which comprises a thousand classes.

The cell containing the Gradio app  can be executed independently.

The purpose of this modest project is solely to experiment, learn, and practice.

Note: Internal links of the main document (jupyter notebook) don't work correctly when the document is displayed in github.
